| Term | Definition | Layer |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Prescriptive Implementation Documentation** | Design documentation that includes clear functional requirements for an activity, including security and other specifications that must be met | |
| **Organization** | Any logical grouping of human, physical, and information resources such as a company, business unit, or team | |
| **Vector** | (1) opportunity for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability in the system, or (2) a path by which neglect could result in unintentional negative outcomes | Layer 1 |
| **Guidance** | A concerted documentation effort to help bring about an optimal future without foreknowledge of the implementation details | Layer 1 |
| **Guideline** | Atomic element of a guidance document; often includes explanatory context and recommendations for designing optimal outcomes | Layer 1 |
| **Threat** | Specifically-scoped opportunity for a negative impact to the organization | Layer 2 |
| **Control** | Safeguard or countermeasure containing a clear objective and assessment requirements | Layer 2 |
| **Assessment Requirement** | Tightly scoped, verifiable condition that must be satisfied and confirmed by an evaluator | Layer 2 |
| **Assessment** | Atomic process used to determine a resource's compliance with an assessment requirement | Layer 5 |
| **Control Catalog** | A set of related controls and relevant metadata | Layer 2 |
| **GRC** | Governance, risk, and compliance; especially a coordinated program dedicated to these elements within a business unit | |
| **Governance** | Strategic oversight of an organization and its activities | |
| **Risk** | The potential for loss or damage when a threat is actualized, determined by calculating the impact of an event to an organization and the likelihood of its occurrence | Layer 3 |
| **Compliance** | Adherence to an active policy | |
| **Risk Catalog** | A group of related risks relevant to an organization; used to determine when and how rules are created for the organization | Layer 3 |
| **Policy** | A clearly-scoped set of rules based on an organization's risk appetite | Layer 3 |
| **Risk Acceptance** | A clearly documented decision to accept an unmitigated risk as necessary or unavoidable | Layer 3 |
| **Finding** | The evidence and opinionated result of an assessment; often used as shorthand for *noncompliance finding* | Layer 5 |
| **Evaluation** | The manual or automated process of forming an opinion on the state of compliance, guided by a set of assessment requirements | Layer 5 |
| **Intent Evaluation** | An evaluation ensuring that a resource is set up to succeed, such as through proper training, configuration, or code | Layer 5 |
| **Behavior Evaluation** | An opinionated observation of simulated or real-world activities | Layer 5 |
| **Opinion** | A firmly held approximation of reality formed within the constraints of an evaluator's philosophy, perspective, and capabilities | Layer 5 |
| **Enforcement** | An action taken in response to noncompliance findings and their causes | Layer 6 |
| **Preventive Enforcement** | Any action that interrupts another process which would otherwise cause noncompliance | Layer 6 |
| **Remediative Enforcement** | Corrective action in response to noncompliance in a deployed activity | Layer 6 |
| **Audit** | A formal, opinionated review of an organization's policies and posture, conducted at a specific point in time to verify that established requirements are met | Layer 7 |
| **Continuous Monitoring** | A multi-system process designed to collect evaluation and telemetry data in an ongoing process to better detect malicious action, enable remediation activities, and observe trends over time | Layer 7 |
