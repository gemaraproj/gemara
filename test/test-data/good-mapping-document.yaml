  - source:
      entry-id: OSPS-AC-01
      entry-type: Control
    target:
      entry-id: ES-IAM-001
      entry-type: Guideline
    relationship: implements
    confidence-level: High
    applicability:
      - "web-applications"
      - "internal-services"
    scope: >
      Authentication assurance only. Does not extend to
      hardware token enforcement or session management.
    rationale: >
      OSPS-AC-01 MFA requirement directly addresses
      the authentication assurance objective in ES-IAM-001.
    remarks: >
      ES-IAM-001 also requires hardware token enforcement,
      which OSPS-AC-01 does not specify.

  - source:
      entry-id: OSPS-AC-02
      entry-type: Control
    target:
      entry-id: ES-IAM-002
      entry-type: Guideline
    relationship: equivalent
    confidence-level: High
    applicability:
      - "all-environments"
    scope: >
      Default permission minimization for human and
      service accounts across all project resources.
    rationale: >
      Both entries require least-privilege defaults with
      identical permission boundaries and escalation rules.

  - source:
      entry-id: OSPS-BR-01
      entry-type: Control
    target:
      entry-id: ES-SDLC-010
      entry-type: Guideline
    relationship: supports
    confidence-level: Medium
    applicability:
      - "containerized-workloads"
      - "compiled-languages"
    scope: >
      Build reproducibility only. Does not address signed
      build attestations, pipeline integrity, or provenance.
    rationale: >
      OSPS-BR-01 contributes to ES-SDLC-010 build integrity
      objective but leaves attestation and provenance unmet.

  - source:
      entry-id: OSPS-AC-01.01
      entry-type: Assessment Requirement
    target:
      entry-id: ES-IAM-001.S1
      entry-type: Statement
    relationship: implemented-by
    confidence-level: High
    applicability:
      - "web-applications"
    scope: >
      MFA enforcement on sensitive version control operations.
      Does not cover MFA for CI/CD pipeline credentials.
    rationale: >
      OSPS-AC-01.01 requires MFA on sensitive resources.
      ES-IAM-001.S1 fulfills this through mandatory
      hardware token enrollment for repository access.

  - source:
      entry-id: OSPS-QA-02
      entry-type: Control
    target:
      entry-id: ES-SDLC-005
      entry-type: Guideline
    relationship: supported-by
    confidence-level: Medium
    applicability:
      - "containerized-workloads"
      - "interpreted-languages"
    scope: >
      Peer review process for application code. Does not
      cover infrastructure-as-code or configuration review.
    rationale: >
      ES-SDLC-005 peer review process contributes to
      OSPS-QA-02 code review requirements but does not
      mandate tooling or coverage thresholds.

  - source:
      entry-id: OSPS-VM-01
      entry-type: Control
    target:
      entry-id: ES-SEC-020
      entry-type: Guideline
    relationship: subsumes
    confidence-level: High
    applicability:
      - "all-environments"
    scope: >
      Vulnerability disclosure, triage, severity
      classification, and remediation timelines.
      ES-SEC-020 only covers disclosure.
    rationale: >
      OSPS-VM-01 fully contains ES-SEC-020 disclosure
      requirements and adds triage workflow, severity
      classification, and remediation SLAs.

  - source:
      entry-id: OSPS-SC-01
      entry-type: Control
    relationship: no-match
    confidence-level: High
    applicability:
      - "all-environments"
    scope: >
      Secure coding education and annual training
      requirements for project contributors.
    rationale: >
      ACME Engineering Standard has no guideline for
      developer security education. This is a gap.

  - source:
      entry-id: OSPS-DP-03
      entry-type: Control
    target:
      entry-id: ES-DATA-007
      entry-type: Guideline
    relationship: relates-to
    confidence-level: Low
    applicability:
      - "data-processing-services"
    scope: >
      Data retention and disposal procedures for
      project telemetry and user-submitted data.
    rationale: >
      Both entries address data handling but differ
      in mechanism. OSPS-DP-03 focuses on retention
      periods; ES-DATA-007 focuses on classification.
      Relationship requires further analysis.
